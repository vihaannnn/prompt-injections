Defense Effectiveness Evaluation Report (FILTERED)
================================================================================

SCENARIO 1: WITH ACCESS CODE

Defense Evaluation Results (FILTERED VERSION):
================================================
Total Attacks in Dataset: 100
  - Evaluated (with improved prompts): 38
  - Skipped (no improved prompts): 62

Among Evaluated Attacks Only:
------------------------------
Original Baseline:
  - Successful attacks: 35 (92.1%)
  - Failed attacks: 3 (789.5%)

After Improved Defense:
  - Successful attacks: 27 (71.1%)
  - Failed attacks: 11 (2894.7%)

True Improvement:
  - Success rate reduction: 21.1%
  - Newly blocked: 11
  - Newly successful: 3
  
Statistical Significance:
  - McNemar's test p-value: 0.0614
  - Significant: NO (alpha=0.05)

Note: This evaluation ONLY considers attacks with improved prompts.
Attacks without improved prompts are excluded from metrics to avoid
bias from weak original prompts.
